Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB) have made it incredibly easy to deploy jobs and wheel files, but there's one major limitation: they don’t help with deploying infrastructure—especially clusters. If you need a cluster to test your code interactively in a notebook with your deployed libraries, you're on your own. This repo contains a practical script to bridge this gap by automating cluster creation, dependency installation, and deployment using Bash and the Databricks API. It helps you provision a cluster and install the wheel file from your Databricks Asset Bundle automatically for easier interactive testing of the code.
